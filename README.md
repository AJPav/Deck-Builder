# Deck-Builder
This is my README set in Markdown for the repo Deck Builder.
<br> I'll be adding some Lua code for TTS in an attempt to create a simulated version of game:
## Battle of Socor
This game has a Notion document which can be found here:<br>https://www.notion.so/The-Battle-of-Socor-c23b0206a7ff4422aa78a26f63481f05
<BR> This Repo is my first initial trial at bulding a virtual game and first time using Lua. For all things code based, I'll be leaving some notes in this README but mostly wil be using Notion for collating ideas and resources. <br> Thanks <BR> Pav
